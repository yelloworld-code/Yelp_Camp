//If an array, the views are looked up in the order they occur in the array.
//Here the directory is view, so even if we launch the express app from some other directory,
//it'll look for "view" directory to deploy views

//since app.use() is before any other route, these select few lines will run for every incoming request, think of app.use, app.get and all the other
//routing methods, as switch case, any request keeps falling down while matching, until it is resolved, so order of these methods matter
